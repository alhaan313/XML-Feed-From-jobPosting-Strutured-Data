international-recruiter-with-english,International Recruiter with English,International Recruiter with English,"Have you ever thought of working as a freelance recruiter?

Either because you want to be schedule-free and work at your own pace or because you want to add an extra income to your current salary?

At Smart-Recruitments, we partner with freelance recruiters from all kinds of areas of expertise to deliver a more effective response to our clients’ needs.

How does it work?
We constantly receive different kinds of requirements from our clients. We ensure to gather all details from the hiring managers and pass them on to our partner recruiters. You will help us find these candidates using whatever method you deem most suitable, screen them via phone or Skype, and then send us their CVs. We will introduce them to our clients. In case of a successful placement, you will receive a commission. There is no fixed commission fee as each placement has a different amount charged to each client. You will receive a percentage of the charged fee.

Location free?
Absolutely. You can be based anywhere in the world. We will have a weekly review call to check the status of the vacancies you are working on, and that’s the only scheduled meeting from our side each week.

Working hours?
Like any other project, the more effort you invest, the more profit you’ll make. If you decide to work with us 8 hours per day, you will make more placements than someone working 2 hours per day. This is entirely up to you, and we welcome all kinds of collaboration.

KPIs or targets?
This is a win-win situation for both of us. The more you bill, the more we bill, so we expect commitment from you, and you can expect the same from us. We anticipate receiving applications from you regularly. Some roles are easier to fill than others, and we are aware of that. The number of expected CVs will vary based on the level of the vacancy. This is how we gauge motivation and distinguish top performers from others.

Are you new to recruitment?
We are more than happy to hear from you. Recruitment is not rocket science, and we will guide you through your first steps to ensure your success. We will teach you about sourcing methods, how to approach passive candidates, and how to evaluate whether they are a good fit for the job. Being new to the industry might even be an advantage as you will likely think outside the box and find candidates where experienced recruiters don’t. We are always just a phone or Skype call away for support.

What to expect from us?
We handle the client communication. All communications with the client will be managed by us. We will chase for feedback on your candidates, push for interviews, and keep you informed throughout the process. We can also create an email account for you with our company name (name@smart-recruitments.com). We are always available on Skype or phone for any questions you might have and will assist you in any way possible. Remember, we share a common goal.

What do we expect from you?
Commitment and consistency. Don’t expect to send one CV and land a placement immediately. It can happen, but it’s rare. The only way to ensure ongoing revenue is to consistently find the best candidates for each role. You will also need to be available for any queries during the client’s business hours and respond promptly when something urgent is required.

How to apply for the freelance recruitment role with us?
Send us an email to info@smart-recruitments.com expressing your interest in working with us, and one of our consultants will call you to book a Skype call where all your questions can be answered.","Have you ever thought of working as a freelance recruiter?<br><br>Either because you want to be schedule-free and work at your own pace or because you want to add an extra income to your current salary?<br><br>At Smart-Recruitments, we partner with freelance recruiters from all kinds of areas of expertise to deliver a more effective response to our clients’ needs.<br><br>How does it work?<br>We constantly receive different kinds of requirements from our clients.
